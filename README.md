The Student Career Recommendation System is a machine learning–based project that analyzes a student’s academic background, skills, interests, and profile information to recommend the most suitable career path. Using a structured dataset and multiple ML models such as Random Forest, SVC, and XGBoost, the system performs preprocessing, feature encoding, model training, evaluation, and deployment, ultimately saving the best-performing model for prediction. This project aims to help students receive personalized, data-driven career guidance and supports educational institutions in making informed recommendations for students’ future career development.
