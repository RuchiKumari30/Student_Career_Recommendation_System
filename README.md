## Overview  
The **Student Career Recommendation System** is a machine learning-based project that helps students choose the **most suitable career path** based on their **academic background**, **skills**, and **interests**.  
It uses machine learning algorithms to analyze educational data and predict the best career match, supporting students in informed career decision-making.

## Objectives  
- Recommend an ideal **career path** for students using data-driven insights.  
- Align students’ **degrees, majors, and skills** with potential job roles.  
- Provide a **personalized prediction** to help plan future career steps.  

---

##  Dataset  
The dataset includes essential student details such as:  
-  **Degree** (e.g., B.Tech, B.Com, B.Sc.)  
-  **Major / Specialization**  
- **Skills / Technical Knowledge**  
-  **Career Path (Target Variable)**  

> The data was cleaned, encoded, and preprocessed for model training and testing.

##  Project Workflow  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** — Removed null values and standardized input data.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** — Analyzed relationships and feature importance.  
3. **Label Encoding** — Converted categorical variables into numerical values.  
4. **Model Training & Evaluation** — Trained models like Random Forest, SVC, and XGBoost.  
5. **Model Saving** — Stored trained model and encoders as `.pkl` files.
